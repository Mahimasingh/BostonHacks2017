# Medifi: An end-to-end encrypted decentralized file sharing network for the secure transfer and easy use of medical records
Medifi is an Web and Android application to share Medical Documents securely via NFC. It stores cholesterol level, insulin level, STD proof, cancer and basic vital details of a user in Blockchain. The medical documents are uploaded by verified license holding doctors who tested the users. On a broader level, this application is used to share medical documents in a secure and indirect way. The target audience would include sperm donors, blood donors, dating couples to check their STD status and by local institutions. It would help users to share information without embarrassment. Also, users would have access to their medical reports without needing to wait for 30 days.

# The Problem
In the United States, accessing one's own medical records can be a timely and frustrating process. It can take 30 days to gain access to medical records and often the request for access is denied [improperly](https://health.usnews.com/health-news/patient-advice/articles/2014/06/05/how-to-get-access-to-your-hospital-records). Even if access is gained it can be unreasonable to search through and manage the thick stack of papers. This is a process known for its incredibly inefficient and cumbersome process - there is clearly much room for improvement.
There have been attempts to digitize medical records and other similar sensitive data using traditional Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 technologies, but these have fallen short. For example, there have been [cases](http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/medical-economics/news/yes-staff-snooping-medical-records-privacy-breach) of staff abusing their adminstrational access to patient records. Traditional databases continue to be the subject of hacks as we have recently seen with the Equifax hack and the ransomware attacks plaguing unsecure databases. With a database acting as a single point of failure it seems this problem cannot be resolved unless a nontraditional approach to data storage is explored.

# The Solution & Medifi
Web 3.0 has brought with it a potential solution for the problem detailed above. Medifi's solution has leverged these emerging technologies to create an end-to-end decentralized file sharing network. This means there is no longer a single point of failure for hackers to exploit. The data itself is secured using SHA256 in a Merkel DAG data structure and users can access the data using the hashes of the SHA256 encryption traced with the help of the Ethereum Blockchain and smart contracts. This means that data can be added and viewed with ease and be stored completely securely.
